This is a snake game project which is made with C++.
Here I used the graphics library <graphics.h>. Using the library I added several objects to my code and use them according to my logic.Which made it easier to me. 
The snake is basically an array. We take a stuct data type to store the coordinates of the head of snake and body. Same goes for the food. 
So here if the snake hits itself by own it dies and the game is over. Besides the length of the snake is limited by 30. 
You can also quit the game by pressing the "esc" button on your keyboard.
